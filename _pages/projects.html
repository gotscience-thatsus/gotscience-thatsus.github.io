        <h2 style="font-size:40px !important; text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
        <p align="justify">The Tech Challenge 2020 is to build a launcher to propel area/volume devices in an arc
          through a hoop to land
          in a designated area. After landing, both area and volume devices should expand into a larger size. The whole
          purpose is to launch, land, and expand meeting all criterias provided.</p>

        </hr>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">1. Safety First</h3>
        <p align="justify">
          To ensure our safety during the experiment and build process, we wore protective gloves, construction helmets,
          and safety goggles. When we were making the catapult, the safety officer also helped ensure that the team was
          staying safe. When We were practicing launching, we did maintain safety precautions and safe distance when
          operating with the Trebuchet.
        </p>

        </hr>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">2. Background Research and Brainstorming Sessions</h3>
        <p align="justify">After doing our background research, the team members came up with different ideas for the
          launching, and
          area/volume expansion devices.

          We started working on the challenge by dividing the problem into separate components, based on the type of
          device:

          Launching
          Landing and expansion

          For each device, we further divided the problem into sub-components. This allowed us to focus and channelize
          our ideas for individual devices.
        </p>

        </hr>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">3. Choosing the best solution</h3>
        </br>
        <h4 align="left"><b>3.1 Launcher </b></h4>
        <p align="justify" style="margin:0;">
          For the launching device, some of the ideas included;
          An air pump based machine that could launch the device into a projectile trajectory.
          A spring design that could generate enough thrust to propel the devices.

          Our key challenges were to come up with a design that could;
        </p>
        <div>
          <ul style="text-align: left; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
            <li>Sustain and support the weight of the (individual) expansion devices during launch;</li>
            <li>Launch the devices with enough force so that they attain the height required to cross the hoop;</li>
            <li>Launch the devices with enough force so that they travel the required distance to reach the landing
              area;</li>
            <li>Ensure that the devices maintain a definite arc, and a safe trajectory after the launch.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p align="justify">
          Based on our discussions in the brainstorming sessions, and some results we saw from rough designs, we decided
          to go with a launch device based on the <b>‘Trebuchet’</b> design.</p>
        <h4 align="left"><b>3.2 Device </b></h4>
        <p align="justify">
          Our research on the expanding devices started with an inflating balloon, which leads us to think, how we
          could make it different and bigger. We came up with a solution for the area device. We put four inflatable
          strips on all four sides of an air pump and attach a webbing using trash bags in between those strips to
          cover more area.</br>
          Another idea was to use fabric to surround most of the device because it is very strong but that won’t
          work out because fabric usually has lots of weight and will make the device hard to fly upward towards the
          hoop. One idea that everyone agreed on was using trash bags to use something to surround the device. That way,
          it surrounds a lot of area because it is not costly and it is good material to work with.
        </p>

        </hr>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">4. Launcher Design</h3>
        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b>4.1 First Prototype for Launcher</b></h4>
        <p align="justify" style="margin:0;">
          To start of with the first prototype for our launcher, here are the following materials we had used:
        </p>
        <div>
          <ul style="text-align: left; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
            <li>Wood planks</li>
            <li>Screws</li>
            <li>Drill Machine</li>
            <li>Saw</li>
            <li>Counter Weight (20Lbs)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p align="justify">
          All of us worked as a team to assemble the Trebuchet by cutting wood with a saw and using a drill machine to
          attach a center column called fulcrum, that way we can launch our device which was at the moment, being
          substituted with a soft ball. Once the Trebuchet was ready, we tried it out with a rubber ball and we
          immediately knew how we could fix it as we could make it better.
        </p>
        <h5 style="text-align: left;"><b>4.1.1 Results and Issues</b></h5>
        <p align="justify">
          Once we each had a turn to launch the ball we were using, we noticed that it wasn't working out. The ball
          wasn’t going that far and was only going two feet high which is not what our goal was because the fulcrum
          was
          not stretchy and flexible that made it hard to launch. It was also breaking apart from the sides and seemed
          like everytime we were trying to launch the ball, the bigger the gap became. Then, we decided to note down
          the
          problems we had that way in our second prototype, it is easier to launch. We noted down that we need
          something
          more stretchy than fulcrum and more stronger wood to use.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b>4.2 Second Prototype for Launcher</b></h4>
        <p align="justify">
          With all the corrections we needed to make that we noted down from the first prototype, we started from
          scratch and made our second prototype. We used the same materials except we decided to use a elastic
          exercise
          band as it is more flexible, sturdy, and would act perfectly as a pouch once we tape the sides of it. Once
          we
          were done building it, it was time to test it with a rubber ball. We noticed how it was easier to launch
          since
          it is more flexible and we just had to place the ball in the <b>pouch</b> we created.
        </p>
        <h5 style="text-align: left;"><b>4.2.1 Results and Issues</b></h5>
        <p align="justify">
          There were no overall issues since the wood was more strong and we had replaced the fulcrum with an elastic
          exercise band. There were no big issues like before but the only thing was that we needed to launch it more
          efficiently. We had discovered that the more we pull it downwards, the more upwards the ball would fly and
          go
          up while if we pull it straight towards us, it would either not go anywhere or, it will go just two feet
          high
          and/or a short distance. That was really the only thing and we thought our launcher was ready and now, it's
          time to build our devices.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">5. Device Design </h3>
        <div></div>
        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b>5.1 Formation of area device</b></h4>
        <p align="justify" style="margin:0;">
          The materials we need in order to build this device is the following:
        </p>
        <div>
          <ul style="text-align: left; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
            <li>Trash Bags</li>
            <li>Plastic Bottle </li>
            <li> Fan</li>
            <li>Scissors and Tape</li>
            <li>Straws</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p align="justify">
          We first made this type of party popper type of design by cutting out the trash bag in a big rectangle shape
          and then closing all the gaps except for one part where we attach the straw. We blew through the straw and
          soon the bag was inflated so we sealed it with duct tape. Once we had four of these party poppers, we started
          building the center part of our device by using a small but strong plastic bottle and attaching the fan that
          way it would fly up. We have not yet tried it to make it fly upwards since it may be in fragile condition so
          we will be continuing to work on it and soon will be working on the volume device as well.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b>5.2 Formation of Volume device</b></h4>
        <p align="justify" style="margin:0;">
          The volume device is an air pump that is attached to 4 bam-bams. The air pump inflated the bam bams, in
          volume, making it a volume device. The air pump is run on a battery motor and runs constantly. At this time,
          our air pump has to be turned on manually, as we couldn't work on the automatic trigger.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          We enjoyed working as a team and helping each other with the whole groups' problems. There was so much more we
          learnt than we would have thought. This challenge made us think outside the box more. It inspires us to do
          engineering projects. We would recommend this challenge to everyone who loves learning
          and thinking. <b>Thank you Tech challenge 2020! for this excellent opportunity.</b>
