        <h2 style="font-size:40px !important; text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
        <p align="justify">The Tech Challenge 2020 is to build a launcher to propel area/volume devices in an arc
          through a hoop to land
          in a designated area. After landing, both area and volume devices should expand into a larger size. The whole
          purpose is to launch, land, and expand meeting all criterias provided.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">1. Safety First</h3>
        <p align="justify">
          To ensure our safety during the experiment and build process, we wore protective gloves, construction helmets,
          and safety goggles. When we were making the catapult, the safety officer also helped ensure that the team was
          staying safe. When We were practicing launching, we did maintain safety precautions and safe distance when
          operating with the Trebuchet.
        </p>

        </hr>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">2. Background Research and Brainstorming Sessions</h3>
        <p align="justify">After doing our background research, the team members came up with different ideas for the
          launching, and
          area/volume expansion devices.

          We started working on the challenge by dividing the problem into separate components, based on the type of
          device: Launching, Landing and expansion.

          For each device, we further divided the problem into sub-components. This allowed us to focus and channelize
          our ideas for individual devices.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">4. Launcher Design</h3>
        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b>4.1 INITIAL IDEAS</b></h4>
        <p align="justify">
          Our first launcher idea was to use a simple concept of fulcrum where the weight will be placed on one side of
          the ramp and the device placed on the other side (Fig 1). We also thought of substituting the weight with a
          stomper (Fig 2)
          <img src="/images/firstPrototype.png" style="width:100%; margin-bottom: 0;">
          However, both the design above did not provide the needed thrust for the device launching.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b>4.2 FIRST PROTOTYPE</b></h4>
        <p align="justify">
          Our next idea was a Trebuchet based design.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/trebuchet.png" style="width:100%;">
        <p align="justify">
          The physics behind a Trebuchet is based on converting the energy of a falling
          counterweight to launch a payload.
        </p>
        <div>
          <ul style="text-align: left; padding: 0;">
            <li>The payload in our case are the ‘area and volume expansion’ devices. But to test our launcher, we used
              different objects to simulate the payload.</li>
            <li>The counterweight, and the payload are connected to the two ends of an ‘arm,’ which rests on a round
              wooden dowel (stick) that is supported on either side by a vertical
              support structure.
            </li>
            <li>The counterweight is much heavier than the payload. The ‘arm’ rests (pivots) on the round dowel in such
              a way that the length of the part of the arm that holds the counterweight is much shorter than the length
              of the arm that holds the payload.</li>
            <li>The length of the long arm (holding the payload) was approximately 3 times the length of the short arm
              (holding the counterweight).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        </hr>
        <h5 style="text-align: left;"><b>4.2.1 Working mechanism</b></h5>
        <p align="justify">
          The long arm is brought down to keep the short arm (and the
          attached heavy counterweight) at a certain height. As the long arm is released, it results
          in the free-fall of the counterweight attached to the short arm. This free-fall makes the
          ‘long arm’ rotate, and as it reaches a certain angle, the payload
          is released.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/workingMechanism.png" style="width:100%;">
        <h5 style="text-align: left;"><b>4.2.2 Observation</b></h5>
        <p align="justify">
          While Trebuchet based design yielded better results than the fulcrum or stomper-based models, we were not able
          to get the needed accuracy to clear a height of 10 feet as well as go through the hula hoop.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b>4.3 SECOND PROTOTYPE</b></h4>
        <p align="justify">
          We used the structure that we built for Trebuchet and converted that into a Slingshot based design.
          The physics behind a Slingshot is based on using the stored energy of an elastic to shoot
          a payload in a projectile motion.
        </p>
        <div>
          <ul style="text-align: left; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
            <li>In our design, we used a heavy string that was attached on either side to the two ends
              of the support structure.
            </li>
            <li>The base on the string (to hold the payload) was prepared using multiple layers of tape.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <img src="/images/secondPrototype.png" style="width:100%;">
        <h5 style="text-align: left;"><b>4.3.1 Working mechanism</b></h5>
        <p align="justify">
          The string is pulled back using the holding base as far as possible,
          to maximize the initial energy that is exerted on the payload (i.e. expansion
          devices) when released. This allows the payload to achieve the required projectile
          trajectory.
        </p>
        <h5 style="text-align: left;"><b>4.3.2 Observation</b></h5>
        <p align="justify">
          We were able to gain enough thrust and clear enough height as well as trajectory. However, we were not able to
          get the consistent accuracy because of the angle of the launch and the pouch that we added to place the device
          was not holding the device consistently.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b>4.4 CHANGES TOWARDS FINAL WORKING LAUNCHER</b></h4>
        <p align="justify">
          We used the structure that we built for Trebuchet and converted that into a Slingshot based design.
          The physics behind a Slingshot is based on using the stored energy of an elastic to shoot
          a payload in a projectile motion.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/finalLauncher.png" style="width:100%;">
        <p align="justify">
          The materials we used in order to build this device are following:
        </p>
        <div>
          <ul style="text-align: left; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
            <li>Wooden Planks</li>
            <li>Wooden Ramp</li>
            <li>Elastic Exercise Band</li>
            <li>Screws</li>
            <li>Weights to make the base stable</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p align="justify">
          To fix the accuracy of the launch and to have a stable base for the device, we added a ramp to the structure
          and
          added a wooden rectangular base where the device can be placed (instead of a pouch from previous design).
        </p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">5. FORMATION OF AREA AND VOLUME DEVICES</h3>
        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b>5.1 INITIAL IDEAS</b></h4>
        <img src="/images/deviceInitialIdea.png" style="width:100%; margin-bottom: 0;">
        <h5 style="text-align: left;"><b>5.1.1 Observation</b></h5>
        <p align="justify">
          After some tests we quickly realized that it’s going to be difficult to create large area expansion with
          window share. Also it was difficult to open up the Hoberman Sphere and keep it open.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b>5.2 FIRST PROTOTYPE</b></h4>
        <p align="justify">
          For the first working prototype, we decided to try idea of inflating a shape cut from trash bag with air
          pressure similar to a balloon expanding.
          We first made this type of party popper type of design by cutting out the trash bag in a big rectangle shape
          and then closing all the gaps except for one part where we attach the straw. We blew through the straw and
          soon the bag was inflated so we sealed it with duct tape.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/deviceFirstPrototype.png" style="width:100%;">
        <p align="justify">
          With the air pressure, the folded shapes cut out from trash bag would expand into a bigger area. We tried
          using a small battery powered aquarium pump to inflate the shape.
        </p>
        <h5 style="text-align: left;"><b>5.2.1 Observation</b></h5>
        <p align="justify">
          Even though the idea worked and produced area expansion, the home made plastic shapes put together with tape
          were very unreliable with shape and expansion.
          Additionally, aquarium pump proved very small and took more than 3-4 minutes to inflate the shape.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b>5.3 CHANGES TOWARDS FINAL WORKING AREA DEVICE</b></h4>
        <p align="justify">
          With the observations from the prototype, we decided to make following changes.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/deviceFinal.png" style="width:100%;">
        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b>5.4 FINAL WORKING AREA DEVICE</b></h4>
        <p align="justify">
          The materials we used in order to build this device is the following:
        </p>
        <div>
          <ul style="text-align: left; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
            <li>Trash Bags</li>
            <li>Plastic Bottle</li>
            <li>Small air pump</li>
            <li>Scissors and Tape</li>
            <li>Straws</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p align="justify">
          We built the center part of our device by using a small but strong plastic bottle and attaching the small air
          pump to generate the air pressure in the bottle. We attached 4 plastic tubes to the plastic bottle to pump the
          air into the inflating shape.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/deviceCenter.png" style="width:100%;">
        <p align="justify">
          As the inflating shapes made from trash bag plastic were unreliable, we decided to use the bam bam sticks to
          instead.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/device-1.png" style="width:100%;">
        <p align="justify">
          Using bam bam sticks as the frame of the expansion device, we attached the triangles cut from the trash bag to
          the bam bam sticks to give us the complete area.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/device-2.png" style="width:100%;">
        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b>5.5 FORMATION OF VOLUME DEVICE</b></h4>
        <p align="justify">
          The volume device uses the same idea as the area but additionally we used a “L” shaped Styrofoam bracket to
          make part of the bam bam stick stand up vertically.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/volume-device-1.png" style="width:100%;">
        <p align="justify">
          With four “L” shaped ban ban sticks and the plastic from trash bag attached between them, the inflated volume
          device looks like this.

        <p align="justify">
          We enjoyed working as a team and helping each other with the whole groups' problems. There was so much more we
          learnt than we would have thought. This challenge made us think outside the box more. It inspires us to do
          engineering projects. We would recommend this challenge to everyone who loves learning
          and thinking. <b>Thank you Tech challenge 2020! for this excellent opportunity.</b>
